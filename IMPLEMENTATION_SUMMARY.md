## Database Migration
A migration script is provided to add workspace codes to existing databases:
```sql
-- Run: backend/src/config/migration_add_workspace_code.sql
```

## Installation & Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` in both backend and frontend
2. Run database migration if needed
3. Configure `.env` file in backend
4. Start backend: `npm start` in backend directory
5. Start frontend: `npm run dev` in frontend directory

## Routes Added
- `/register-team-member` - Team member registration
- Enhanced `/dashboard` routing based on user role

## API Endpoints Added
- `POST /api/auth/register-team-member` - Register team member with workspace code

## Files Modified/Created
