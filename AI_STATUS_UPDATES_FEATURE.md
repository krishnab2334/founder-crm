# AI-Powered Task Status Updates Feature

## Overview
This feature enhances the task management system with AI-powered status message beautification. Team members can update task statuses with optional messages, which are automatically beautified by AI to create clear, professional updates for the founder to review on their dashboard.

## Key Features

### 1. **AI Status Message Beautification**
- When a team member updates a task status, they can add a status message
- The AI automatically enhances this message to be:
  - Clear and professional
  - Easy to understand for busy founders
  - Contextual with task details
  - Concise (2-3 sentences maximum)

### 2. **AI Suggestions for Team Members**
- Team members can request AI-generated suggestions for status updates
- AI provides 3-4 professional example messages based on:
  - Task title and description
  - Task category
  - Current status
  - Task context

### 3. **Enhanced Founder Dashboard**
- Founders see beautified status messages directly on their dashboard
- Messages include:
  - Clear status update from team member
  - Timestamp of the update
  - Visual indicators (emoji, styling)
  - Context about the task

### 4. **Seamless Team Member Experience**
- Easy-to-use status update modal
- Click-to-use AI suggestions
- Visual feedback during AI processing
- Beautiful, intuitive UI

## Database Changes

### New Columns in `tasks` Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN beautified_status_message TEXT AFTER status;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN last_status_update TIMESTAMP NULL AFTER beautified_status_message;
```

**Migration File:** `backend/src/config/add_beautified_status.sql`

## Backend Implementation

### AI Service Methods

#### 1. `beautifyTaskStatus(taskData, statusUpdate, userMessage)`
Enhances a raw status message into a professional, founder-friendly update.

**Input:**
```javascript
{
  title: "Task title",
  category: "sales",
  priority: "high",
  status: "in_progress",
  oldStatus: "todo",
  assignedToName: "John Doe",
  contactName: "Acme Corp" // optional
}
```

**Output:**
```javascript
{
  beautifiedMessage: "John Doe has begun work on the high-priority sales task...",
  summary: "Task in progress",
  suggestedActions: ["Review progress", "Provide feedback"]
}
```

#### 2. `generateStatusSuggestions(taskData)`
Generates AI-powered suggestions for status updates.

**Output:**
```javascript
{
  suggestions: [
    "Making good progress on this task",
    "Completed successfully with positive results",
    "Encountered some blockers, need assistance"
  ]
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### POST `/api/ai/beautify-task-status`
Manually beautify a status message (used by team members for preview).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "taskId": 123,
  "statusMessage": "finished the initial draft"
}
```

#### GET `/api/ai/task-status-suggestions/:taskId`
Get AI suggestions for a specific task.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "suggestions": ["suggestion1", "suggestion2", "suggestion3"]
  }
}
```

### Task Update Enhancement
The `PUT /api/tasks/:id` endpoint now accepts an optional `status_message` field and automatically beautifies it when the status changes.

3. They can:
